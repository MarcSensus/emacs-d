;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides a function `scratch' that is similar to `shell',
;; `info', `grep', and other such functions.  By this I mean M-x
;; scratch takes you to the *scratch* buffer if one exists, otherwise
;; it generates a new *scratch* buffer.  User-defined customizations
;; along the following lines allow you to choose a new name for the
;; scratch buffer, or to use a different major mode, or to add minor
;; modes:
;;
;; (defun itch () (interactive)
;;   (scratch "*itch*"))
;;
;; (defun notes () (interactive)
;;   (scratch "*notes*" 'text-mode))
;;
;; (defun music () (interactive)
;;   (scratch "*music*" 'fundamental-mode
;;                      'musical-letters-mode
;;                      'auto-fill-mode))
;;
;; The function `back-from-scratch' is also provided, to take you
;; back from your most recent scratch buffer to the previous buffer
;; (restoring the window configuration).
;;
;; For those who use the basic functionality, I recommend reading the
;; documentation of `lisp-interaction-mode'.
;;
;; In order to use these functions effectively, you may want to bind
;; them to keystrokes:
;;
;; Here are a couple suggested bindings for the main functions:
;; (C-s-SPC and C-s-RET):
;;
;; (global-set-key (quote [75497504]) 'scratch)
;; (global-set-key (quote [C-s-return]) 'back-from-scratch)
;;
;; And for the derived functions, you can use things like this
;; (C-s-m):
;;
;; (global-set-key (quote [8388621]) 'music)

;;; History:

;; Earlier this year, I encouraged the Emacs developers to make
;; `info' more like `shell', and they did, which I appreciated.  This
;; mode is inspired by this new more consistent interface.

(defun scratch (&optional buffername initmode &rest minormodes)
  "Access an existing scratch buffer or create one anew if none exists.
This is similar to the function `shell' for accessing or creating
an interactive shell.

Optional argument BUFFERNAME specifies the scratch buffer name;
the default buffer name is *scratch*.

Optional argument INITMODE specifies the major mode in which the
scratch buffer should be initialized; the default mode is
`initial-major-mode'.

Any remaining arguments are MINORMODES to apply in the scratch
buffer."

;;; Notes:

;; There is not any explicit type checking in `scratch', so if you
;; suspect that someone might pass something other than modes in for
;; `initmode' and/or `minormodes', well, you had better hope that they
;; know what they are doing.  We could add tests similar to the
;; `with-temp-buffer' test we already use to detect whether these
;; things that are being passed in are actually functions that set up
;; modes, but that seems like overkill at this point.

;; It would be nice to be able to provide an easy way to custom
;; accessor functions, but that seems to involve interning
;; new symbols as part of the customization process, and I'm not sure how
;; to do that.
